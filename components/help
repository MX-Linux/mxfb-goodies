Tint2 config files must be in $TINT2PATH, set by default to $HOME/.config/tint2/
-----------------------------------

When the dialog opens, any running tint2s will be checkmarked.

Click "Apply" and all running tint2s are stopped,
   and all checkmarked tint2s are started.

To stop a tint2 just uncheck it, and "Apply".

Running tint2s are saved to a session file, and can be run with
   the "tint2-session" script. To start them at login, add the
   following line to autostart:

           tint2session
