# mxfb-goodies
Optional scripts for MX-Fluxbox that are useful but have not been included in the default installation for one reason or another.

	-- mxfb-appearance: provides graphic access to the items under Menu > Appearance, with the exception of Style. Can be used on a dock, in a traditional panel, or as a desktop icon.

	-- recent_files.sh: presents a clickable list of the files used in the last 30 days, sorted from last to first. Can be inserted into the rootMenu, or linked with a desktop, dock or panel icon.

	-- tiles: inserts code into the keys file that enables 1/4, 1/3 or 1/2 screen tiling.
